## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface, combined with a backend that communicates with the database to store data permanently and enable project and cost management. Additionally, the project budget is updated with every operation, meaning that beyond the usual CRUD operations, the backend also has extra validations.

## Features

- Project creation with a budget.
- View, edit, and delete projects.
- Service creation with a cost associated with the project.
- View and remove services.
- Detailed error and business rule exposure.
- Integration with MySQL database.
